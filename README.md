# PacketSniffer

Basic packet sniffer including IP defragmentation and TCP reassembly.

Still a work in progress and intending to only support TCP/UDP and HTTP/DNS.

This is a POC that is intended to sit on an endpoint (POSIX compliant system) and sniff & display all incoming connections and the reconstructed data with the ability for the user to apply filters.
